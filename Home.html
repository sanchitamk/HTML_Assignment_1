            Spotify is opening up foreign language markets to its podcasters through artificial intelligence.

The company on Monday announced a pilot program called Voice Translation for podcasts that not only translates a podcast from one language to another but will retain the podcaster’s voice as it does it.

Spotify’s new translation tool, which uses OpenAI’s voice generation technology, can clone a speaker’s voice characteristics to make a translation sound more natural.

                             Microsoft recently announced that Copilot, the company’s implementation of generative AI, will be coming soon to Windows and Office 365. While Microsoft is already using generative AI in its Bing search engine, its introduction to Microsoft’s core productivity tools promises to redefine how we interact with technology at work and home.

                             I’ve been disappointed in almost all the launch events I’ve seen since we mainly moved to virtual events. Most aren’t that different than in-person events where the speaker(s) get up on stage and pontificate.

                            The AnkerWork B600 Video Bar is a powerful all-in-one conferencing device that is probably more suited for a business conference room than a work-from-home office. AnkerWork tries to thread the needle in stitching together features that either user category finds attractive.

                            Google hammered another nail in the coffin for passwords Tuesday when it announced it’s making passkeys the default login method for its personal accounts.

                            Generative AI produces outputs with increasing similarity to human-generated content — and with exponentially greater efficiency.

                            Artificial intelligence concerns more Americans than it excites, although few think the technology will have a significant impact on their jobs, according to a pair of studies released Monday by a Washington, D.C. think tank.
