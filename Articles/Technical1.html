          The AnkerWork B600 Video Bar is a powerful all-in-one conferencing device that is probably more suited for a business conference room than a work-from-home office. AnkerWork tries to thread the needle in stitching together features that either user category finds attractive.

I’m in the latter worker group and found this advanced conferencing tool more than adequate for both single-participant sessions and larger group attendance when I needed to hold video sessions in other conference rooms.

Priced at US$199.99, the B600 may be considered premium for home users without frequent business needs, and it doesn’t quite deliver the flair I expected at this price point.

I am not saying this product falls short for home office and big office tasks. It does its job well but is a bit pricey for casual users in either situation. If you are looking for better video quality beyond your laptop’s built-in camera or add one to your cam-less desktop monitor, you will pay a higher price for this unit for features you will probably never use.

Ultimately, however, if you want to enhance your virtual meeting activities and add a bit of convenience and flair to your videoconferencing routines, the B600 could be well worth the price.

Compelling All-in-One Design
This webcam is top-heavy, thanks to its large light bar that folds down over the lens and sensor residing in the large speaker and components case.

The upper portion rotates a full 360 degrees and tilts downward to 180 degrees. So, the lighting, sensors, and lens can swivel to nearly any angle to accommodate workspace conditions.

A fabric sheath surrounds the speaker case, making it easy to handle with a nice appearance.
